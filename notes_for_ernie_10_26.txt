New concepts:
1. Closures
2. this
    - when passed as a callback
        - use bind
	- inner functions cannot access the this of the outer function
	    - closures... this and that - oh boy!
	    - var that = this in the outer function, so the inner functions can acces it!
	- when function using this gets assigned to a variable
	    - use bind to associate the intended object with this, instead of the implied default (global - undefined, window etc.)
	- borrowing methods
	    - when you want to apply the data of another object on this objects methods, you need to reset "this". The way to do it is to use apply!
3. apply, bind, and call
4. Creating objects
     - object literals - directly assign
     - new Object(); - calls the object constructor, very basic
     - constructor patterns - create a pattern and call new on it. Inheritance.
5. Accessing properties:
     - dot notation mango.color = "yellow"
     - [] notation with property in "" -> mango["color"] = "yellow"
     - own and inherited properties
         - own were defined on the object
         - inherited were obtained from the prototype's object
         - use "in" opertor to check for properties
